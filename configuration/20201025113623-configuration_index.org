Disclaimer:
all these docs is my personal attempt to use a structured documentation approach.
So far docs these docs are organized in linked files that contain FAQs with tags that specify the expected acctitude to dig into them.



* Tags
  #+BEGIN_SRC dot :file images/dot_test.png
digraph a {
        newbie [shape=box];
  newbie -> common_lisp;
  lisp -> scheme;
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:images/dot_test.png]]


Existent tags are:
- newbie
- beginner
- curious


* Configuration

** how emacs is normally configured?                               :begginer:
   Normally an emacs configuration consists on one file ~init.el~ located in ~~/.emacs~ folder.
   There are some options to modularize/refine the config in several places but you can also have all the emacs configuration settins in this ~init.el~ file.

   Of coure more on this topic is fully available on [[https://duckduckgo.com/?q=emacs+configuration&atb=v120-1&ia=web][internet]]

** why this emacs config used [[id:D704D422-37F8-4861-894E-25E1F1215EC2][literate programming]] and [[id:D8F4651F-5768-4D7F-9432-42CA6EC198EC][org-roam-mode]]? :begginer:curious:
   Well, literate programming advocate to write /human/ docs more that develop code. And my personal /wish/ when I config some tool is to understand the settings (so i could adapt them to my preferences or needs) more than just copy/pasting just code.
   if you go into this file: [[id:D704D422-37F8-4861-894E-25E1F1215EC2][literate programming]] and take a look to the examples provides you'll realise about the chaging role in developing code.
** WAITING how is this literate config loaded in emacs?             :curious:
*** how to avoid org compilation?
    untangle mode
** WAITING create emacs drawing
