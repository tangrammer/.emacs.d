Cask can be likened to venv or maven for Emacs Lisp development, although, as with all things emacs, is decidedly less sophisticated (but no less arcane).

Cask simplifies sandboxing that more expert elisp developers accomplish directly with emacs’s built-in -Q, --batch, and --eval switches. Within the sandbox, Cask provisions dependencies via a user-defined “Cask” file analogous to requirements-dev.txt or pom.xml.
