trying this [[file:20201110102857-org_download.org][org-download]] approach
 https://zzamboni.org/post/how-to-insert-screenshots-in-org-documents-on-macos/

the approach use https://github.com/jcsalterego/pngpaste
I've installed it using homebrew =brew install pngpaste=
pay attention that to use the clipboard you need the key control
so C+COMMAND+MAYS+4 to make the normal osx screenshot but leaving it in the clipboard
then =C-M-y= and it's configured on [[file:20201110102857-org_download.org][org-download]]


- anyway there is another alternatives around like  https://github.com/dfeich/org-screenshot


 
example:

#+DOWNLOADED: screenshot @ 2020-11-10 10:54:31
[[file:images/20201110-105431_screenshot.png]]
