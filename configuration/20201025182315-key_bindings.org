examples
 #+BEGIN_SRC 

 (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> <f9>") 'org-agenda-list)
 (global-set-key (kbd "<f9> <f8>") (lambda () (interactive) (org-capture nil "r")))


 #+END_SRC



If you want to rebind something that was previously bound to a non-prefix map, you can unbind it first:

~(global-unset-key (kbd "<f9>"))~
