** which-key
 https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key

 =which-key= is a minor mode for Emacs that displays the key bindings
   following your currently entered incomplete command (a prefix) in a
   popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter =C-x= and wait
   for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with all of the
   available key bindings that follow =C-x= (or as many as space allows given
   your settings).  This includes prefixes like =C-x 8= which are shown in a
   different face. Screenshots of what the popup will look like are included
   below. =which-key= started as a rewrite of [[https://github.com/kai2nenobu/guide-key][guide-key-mode]], but the feature
   sets have diverged to a certain extent.
