#+title: Buttercup Behavior-Driven Emacs Lisp Testing

[[id:A4169737-CA7A-460F-A331-DE9561C4C1FC][testing]]

Buttercup is a behavior-driven development framework for testing Emacs Lisp code. It allows to group related tests so they can share common set-up and tear-down code, and allows the programmer to “spy” on functions to ensure they are called with the right arguments during testing.

The framework is heavily inspired by [[https://jasmine.github.io/tutorials/your_first_suite][Jasmine]].
